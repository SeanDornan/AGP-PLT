
What has been attempted from the specification:

All the shaders
Light Source (taken from Lab 4 base code)

What has been left out:

Location x with Gouraud (was attempted then deleted)
Interleaved vertex buffer (wasn't sure where to start. Tried looking for tutorials online but most were pretty vague) Again, I did attempt it but I had no luck with it, decided to then leave it out
Git Hub commit history (still not comfortable with Github, but I'm trying my best, I should be more comfortable with it as time goes on)

Group member: Dale Thomson
Individual Projects: Still discussing between each other on what we could do separately, we will have decided by the end of this week (by the 21st of October)
